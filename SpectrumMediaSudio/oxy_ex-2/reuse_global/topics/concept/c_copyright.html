Use of our product(s) and any updates thereto
     purchased or validly obtained by you (the "Products"), and/or the Software (as defined below)

     the Software as defined below or using the Software preloaded or embedded in your System. As
     used herein, the term "Software" means the <span class="- topic/keyword keyword"><span class="- topic/tm tm">Harmonic<span class="- topic/tmmark tmmark ">®</span></span></span> owned software
     and/or firmware used in or with the Products and embedded into, provided with or loaded onto

     Software"). If you do not agree to this Agreement, you shall promptly return the System with a
     dated receipt to the seller for a full refund. </li>
    <li class="- topic/li li">LICENSE: Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement (including payment), we
     hereby grant you a nonexclusive, nontransferable license to use the object code version of the
     Software embedded into, provided solely for use with or loaded onto the Product, and the
     accompanying documentation ("Documentation") for your internal business purposes. The Software
     and any authorized copies are owned by us or our suppliers, and are protected by law, including
     without limitation the copyright laws and treaties of the U.S.A. and other countries.
     Evaluation versions of the Software may be subject to a time-limited license key.</li>
    <li class="- topic/li li">RESTRICTIONS: You (and your employees and contractors) shall not attempt to reverse
     engineer, disassemble, modify, translate, create derivative works of, rent, lease (including
     use on a timesharing, applications service provider, service bureau or similar basis), loan,
     distribute, sublicense or otherwise transfer the System, in whole or part except to the extent
     otherwise permitted by law. The Software may be operated on a network only if and as permitted
     by its Documentation. You may make one (1) back up copy of the object code of the Software for
     archival purposes only. Evaluation Software will be run in a lab, nonproductive environment.
     Results of any benchmark or other performance tests may not be disclosed to any third party
     without our prior written consent. Title to and ownership of the Software and Documentation,
     and all copyright, patent, trade secret, trademark, and other intellectual property rights in
     the System, shall remain our or our licensors' property. You shall not remove or alter any
     copyright or other proprietary rights notice on the System. We reserve all rights not expressly
     granted.</li>
    <li class="- topic/li li">LIMITED WARRANTY: (a) Limited Warranty. We warrant to you that, commencing on your receipt
     of a Product and terminating 1 year thereafter, the System will perform substantially in
     accordance with its then-current appropriate Documentation. The Product (including
     replacements) may consist of new, used or previously-installed components. (b) Remedies. If the
     System fails to comply with such warranty during such period, as your sole remedy, you must
     return the same in compliance with our product return policy, and we shall, at our option,
     repair or replace the System, provide a workaround, or refund the fees you paid. Replacement
     Systems are warranted for the original System's remaining warranty period. (c) Exclusions.
     EVALUATION SOFTWARE IS LICENSED ON AS-IS BASIS AND SUBJECT TO 4(d). We will have no obligation
     under this limited warranty due to: (i) negligence, misuse or abuse of the System, such as
     unusual physical or electrical stress, misuse or accidents; (ii) use of the System other than
     in accordance with the Documentation; (iii) modifications, alterations or repairs to the System
     made by a party other than us or our representative; (iv) the combination, operation or use of
     the System with equipment, devices, software or data not supplied by us; (v) any third party
     hardware or Third Party Software, whether or not provided by us; (vi) any failure other than by
     us to comply with handling, operating, environmental, storage or maintenance requirements for
     the System in the Documentation, including, without limitation, temperature or humidity ranges.
     (d) Disclaimers. We are not responsible for your software, firmware, information, or data
     contained in, stored on, or integrated with any Product returned to us for repair or
     replacement. SUCH LIMITED WARRANTY IS IN LIEU OF, AND WE SPECIFICALLY DISCLAIM, ANY AND ALL
     OTHER WARRANTIES, WHETHER EXPRESS, IMPLIED OR STATUTORY, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, ANY
     IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF SATISFACTORY QUALITY, MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE
     OR NON-INFRINGEMENT. WE DO NOT WARRANT THAT THE SYSTEM WILL MEET YOUR REQUIREMENTS OR BE
     UNINTERRUPTED OR ERROR-FREE. NO ADVICE OR INFORMATION, WHETHER ORAL OR WRITTEN, OBTAINED FROM
     US OR ELSEWHERE, WILL CREATE ANY WARRANTY NOT EXPRESSLY STATED IN THIS AGREEMENT. Some
     jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion of implied warranties or limitations on how long an
     implied warranty may last, so such exclusions may not apply to you. In that event, such implied
     warranties or limitations are limited to 60 days from the date you purchased the System or the
     shortest period permitted by applicable law, if longer. This warranty gives you specific legal
     rights and you may have other rights which vary from state to state or country to country.</li>
    <li class="- topic/li li">LIMITATION OF LIABILITY: WE AND OUR AFFILIATES, SUPPLIERS, LICENSORS, OR SALES CHANNELS

     DAMAGES. NOTWITHSTANDING ANY OTHER PROVISIONS OF THIS AGREEMENT, WE AND OUR REPRESENTATIVES'
     TOTAL LIABILITY TO YOU ARISING FROM OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT OR THE SYSTEM SHALL BE
     LIMITED TO THE TOTAL PAYMENTS TO US UNDER THIS AGREEMENT FOR THE SYSTEM. THE FOREGOING
     LIMITATIONS SHALL NOT APPLY TO DEATH OR PERSONAL INJURY TO PERSONS OR TANGIBLE PROPERTY IN ANY

     LIABILITY OR DAMAGES DUE TO THE LOSS OF ANY SUCH DATA OR FILES. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW
     THE EXCLUSION OR LIMITATION OF INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, SO SUCH EXCLUSIONS MAY NOT
     APPLY TO YOU. </li>
    <li class="- topic/li li">CONFIDENTIALITY: Information in the System and the associated media, as well as the
     structure, organization and code of the Software, are proprietary to us and contain valuable
     trade secrets developed or acquired at great expense to us or our suppliers. You shall not
     disclose to others or utilize any such information except as expressly provided herein, except

     confidentiality obligations; (ii) generally available to the public without breach of this
     Agreement; (iii) lawfully known to the user prior to its receipt of the System; or (iv)
     required by law to be disclosed.</li>

     specify. Upgrades do not extend the limited warranty period.</li>

     <p class="- topic/p p">GENERAL: You shall not assign, delegate or sublicense your rights or obligations under this
      Agreement, by operation of law or otherwise, without our prior written consent, and any
      attempt without such consent shall be void. Subject to the preceding sentence, this Agreement
      binds and benefits permitted successors and assigns. This Agreement is governed by California
      law, without regard to its conflicts of law principles. The U.N. Convention on Contracts for
      the International Sale of Goods is disclaimed. If any claim arises out of this Agreement, the
      parties hereby submit to the exclusive jurisdiction and venue of the federal and state courts
      located in Santa Clara County, California. In addition to any other rights or remedies, we
      shall be entitled to injunctive and other equitable relief, without posting bond or other
      security, to prevent any material breach of this Agreement. We may change the terms,
      conditions and pricing relating to the future licensing of our Systems and other intellectual
      property rights, including this Agreement, from time to time. No waiver will be implied from
      conduct or failure to enforce rights nor effective unless in a writing signed on behalf of the
      party against whom the waiver is asserted. If any part of this Agreement is found
      unenforceable, the remaining parts will be enforced to the maximum extent permitted. There are
      no third-party beneficiaries to this Agreement. We are not bound by additional and/or
      conflicting provisions in any order, acceptance, or other correspondence unless we expressly
      agree in writing. This Agreement is the complete and exclusive statement of agreement between
      the parties as to its subject matter and supersedes all proposals or prior agreements, verbal
      or written, advertising, representations or communications concerning the System.</p>
